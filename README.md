# Examining the Global Cybersecurity Index 

The [Global Cybersecurity Index](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/global-cybersecurity-index.aspx) (GCI) measure the commitment of countries around the world to cybersecurity. The score reflects what the country has done regarding its national cybersecurity: legal measures, technical measures, organizational measures, capacity building, and cooperation.

The scores range from 0 to 1, and countries with index scores closer to 1 are further advanced in cybersecurity than those with scores closer to 0.

GCI is calculated by the [International Telecommunication Union](https://www.itu.int/en/about/Pages/default.aspx), the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies. ITU publishes the [Global Cybersecurity Index](https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/str/D-STR-GCI.01-2018-PDF-E.pdf) report every other year and measures the "readiness" of each country. Version 3 of the report covers 2018, and the relevant table is listed in Annex-A.

Two charts were created as [visualizations](https://fr48.github.io/gci) for the GCI data.
