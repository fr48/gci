Every country has a vested interest in protecting information and keeping citizens safe. But there is a difference in how each country handles it.</p> <p>Effective cybersecurity is absolutely critical in a world that is increasingly interconnected, as people rely on online services, digitally connected devices, and Internet of Things for work, communications, entertainment, education, and commerce. An attack can disrupt company operations and a data breach can compromise the consumer's ability to shop online. </p> <p>Countries have to balance a number of technical, legal, policy, and security decisions as part of their cybersecurity strategy. The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) measures "the commitment of countries to cybersecurity," according to the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency. The index recognizes there are multiple dimensions to the issue, and that just doing one thing well isn't sufficient. The idea of the GCI is to show that security is a journey, and each country has its own path to follow.</p>
</div> <div class="story-body"> <h3>The Global Cybersecurity Index, 2018</h3> <p>Each country’s level of development or engagement is assessed along five pillars – (i) Legal Measures, (ii) Technical Measures, (iii) Organizational Measures, (iv) Capacity Building, and (v) Cooperation – and then aggregated into an overall score. </p> <p> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="asia-btn">Asia</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="africa-btn">Africa</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="me-btn">Middle East</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="europe-btn">Europe</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="sa-btn">South America</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="na-btn">North America</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="rf-btn">Former USSR Countries</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="au-btn">Australia</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="continent-btn">Color by continent</button> <button class="btn btn-warning" id="reset-btn">Reset</button> <div id="chart-1"></div>  </p><p>Source: <a href="https://itu.int/">International Telecommunication Union</a>, Global Cybersecurity Index 2018</p>
</div> <script src="chart-01.a8138825.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p>ITU has been measuring GCI every other year since 2014, and the 2018 index is the third in the series. The valuable part of the index is that the countries are compared to themselves, so how they handle the five dimensions doesn't get overshadowed by the fact that it is a smaller country, or a country with lower GDP compared to its neighbors. </p>
</div> <div class="story-body"> <h3>Global Cybersecurity Index Over the Years</h3> <p>The country's position on the index can fluctuate over the years as new technical controls are developed and new laws are passed. A selection of countries from around the world have seen their index scores fluctuate from 2014 to 2018 as they grapple with new requirements. </p> <div id="chart-2"></div>  <p>Source: <a href="https://itu.int/">International Telecommunication Union</a>, Global Cybersecurity Index 2014, 2016, 2018</p>
</div> <script src="chart-02.624cce13.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p>Singapore ranked first in 2016, followed by the United States, and then Malaysia. With the 2018 index, the United Kingdom, United States, and France made up the top 3. Singapore was ranked sixth, and Malaysia ranked eighth. That doesn't mean, however, that Singapore and Malaysia "fell" on its cybersecurity efforts, or that it declined in its abilities and controls, since both increased their index score. The global rankings are more to show who is further along in their programs, but doesn't say one is "better" or "worse" in their efforts. </p> <p>Cybersecurity is a process, not a journey. There is no "end" because there is always room for refinement, and the countries are well on their way.</p>
